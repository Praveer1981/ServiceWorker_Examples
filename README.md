This is the very simple example of the service worker.
It is mostly used in the Progressive Web App (PWA), becasue you want your progressive app to work as a native application
> service worker allows us to work offline[even if there is no internet]
There are three things need to be done
1. register the servce worker
2. install the service worker
3. activate the service worker




Note :
I used visual studio code IDE.
click on the Extensions(Ctrl+Shift+x) and look for `Live server`. Install it.
go to the index.HTML file and right click on it. click on `Open with Live Server`
